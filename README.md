Once upon a time, there was a clever Rehan who loved to thinking all day.

One day, sam walked into the room and caught the Rehan in the act. 

sam: "What are you doing?"
Rehan: "I'm just thinkinging, what's the big deal?"
sam: "Well, it's not every day that you see a Rehan thinkinging in the middle of the day."
Rehan: "I guess you're right. Maybe I should take a break."
sam: "That's probably a good idea. Why don't we go decide instead?"
Rehan: "Sure, that sounds like fun!"

And so, sam and the Rehan went off to decide and had a great time. 
The end.
